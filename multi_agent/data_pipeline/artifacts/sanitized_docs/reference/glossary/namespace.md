# Namespace

An abstraction used by Kubernetes to support isolation of groups of API resources
within a single cluster.

 

Namespaces are used to organize objects in a cluster and provide a way to divide cluster resources. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespace-based scoping is applicable only for namespaced resources _(for example: Pods, Deployments, Services)_ and not for cluster-wide resources _(for example: StorageClasses, Nodes, PersistentVolumes)_.
