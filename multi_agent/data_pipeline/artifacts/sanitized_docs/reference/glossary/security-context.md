# Security Context

The `securityContext` field defines privilege and access control settings for
a Pod or
container.

In a `securityContext`, you can define: the user that processes run as,
the group that processes run as, and privilege settings.
You can also configure security policies (for example: SELinux, AppArmor or seccomp).

The `PodSpec.securityContext` setting applies to all containers in a Pod.
