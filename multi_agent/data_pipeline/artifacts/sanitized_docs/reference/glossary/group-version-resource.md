# Group Version Resource

Means of representing specific Kubernetes APIs uniquely.

Group Version Resources (GVRs) specify the API group, API version, and _resource_ (name for the object kind as it appears in the URI) associated with accessing a particular id of object in Kubernetes.
GVRs let you define and distinguish different Kubernetes objects, and to specify a way of accessing
objects that is stable even as APIs change.

In this usage, _resource_ refers to an HTTP resource. Because some APIs are namespaced, a GVR may
not refer to a specific API resource.
